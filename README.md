# Natural language processing - conference research project
This research is an independent study course under the guidance of Professor Andrew Petersen at University of Toronto Mississauga.

## web scraping software
### scraping-adv.py
For using this software for pulling names and contextual information from two conference websites in the domain of Artificial Intelligence:

Make sure you have installed Python3.0 or higher and JAVA 8 (in order to use tika for parsing pdf) in your computer, as well as install and import all modules properly.

The conference websites are listed below and the example output are showing in the example_output folder.

AAAI Conference:    
urls = ['https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20/',
        'https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-19/',
        'https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-18/',
        'https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai17.php',
        'https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai16.php',
        'https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai15.php',
        'https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai14.php',
        'https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai13.php']

APPLIED AI Summit:
urls = ['https://www.re-work.co/events/applied-ai-summit-san-francisco-2021',
         'https://www.re-work.co/events/applied-ai-summit-san-francisco-2020',
         'https://www.re-work.co/events/applied-ai-summit-san-francisco-2019',
         'https://www.re-work.co/events/applied-ai-summit-houston-2018']
         
## AI Conference diversity research
In the folder: ai conference diversity, data and software are included, and final report is in Analysis.

The goal of the research is to identify whether particular fields are open to minorities of various sorts (gender, ethnic background) by mining the major conferences for a field for 5-10 years to see
(a) who is attending / presenting 
(b) who is placed in a position of responsibility or prominence (like a session chair, keynote speaker or author). 

This will require mining webpages of various sorts and using NLP to try to identify key pieces of information.

## Graduate diversity research
In the folder: graduate diversity, data and software are included, and final report is in Analysis.

The goal of the research is to identify whether particular fields - STEM are open to minorities of various sorts (gender, ethnic background) by mining the published papers' authors for 5 years to see
(a) who is enrolled in the STEM 
(b) possible influence of the diversity of graduates in STEM.
